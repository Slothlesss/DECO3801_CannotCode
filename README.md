## Welcome to "Mind Over Matter"
Mind Over Matter is a brain-computer interaction (BCI) powered 2D side scroller game in which players control a spaceship and must fly as far as possible without crashing. The player will have to avoid procedurally generated obstacles including asteroids, moons, planets and other spaceships. Certain obstacles can also be shot by the laser cannons on the playerâ€™s ship to destroy them. The playerâ€™s ship will be controlled using the traditional paradigm of a keyboard, however the gameâ€™s environment will automatically adapt to the userâ€™s cognitive state based on data sent by an EEG (electroencephalogram) headset.
